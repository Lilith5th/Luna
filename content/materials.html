            <h3>Best Materials for the Inflatable Structure</h3>
            <h4>Vectran</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> High-performance thermoplastic multifilament yarn with exceptional tensile strength, low elongation, and high resistance to cuts and abrasion.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Used in aerospace applications due to its durability and ability to withstand extreme conditions, providing excellent structural support for the inflatable habitat.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Kevlar</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Aramid fiber known for its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to impact and heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Adds additional structural integrity and puncture resistance, ideal for the outer layers of the habitat to protect against micrometeorites and other impacts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Aluminized Mylar</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Polyester film known for its reflective properties, excellent barrier to heat and radiation when aluminized.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Used as a reflective layer in the multi-layer insulation (MLI) blankets, providing thermal control and protection against solar and cosmic radiation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Polyurethane-Coated Fabrics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Provides waterproofing, flexibility, and resistance to environmental degradation.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Serves as the innermost layer of the inflatable structure, ensuring airtightness and preventing leaks.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>ETFE (Ethylene Tetrafluoroethylene)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> High strength, corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand a wide range of temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Durable, light-weight films used in construction of the inflatable habitat, beneficial for lighting and plant growth within the habitat.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Aerogel</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Highly porous, lightweight materials with exceptional insulating properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Integrated into the habitatâ€™s walls for additional thermal insulation without adding significant weight.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Multi-Layer Construction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Outer Layer:</strong> Kevlar reinforced with Vectran for structural integrity, impact resistance, and protection against micrometeorites.</li>
                <li><strong>Intermediate Layers:</strong> Aluminized Mylar as part of Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) blankets for thermal control and radiation protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Inner Layer:</strong> Polyurethane-coated fabrics or ETFE for airtightness and preventing leaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Insulation Layer:</strong> Aerogel blankets for thermal insulation, maintaining a stable internal temperature.</li>
            </ul>
