            <h3>Sustainable Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utilization of in-situ resources:</strong> For construction and daily operations, reducing dependence on resupply missions from Earth.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced recycling systems:</strong> Minimize waste and maximize resource use, essential for maintaining a closed-loop ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydroponic gardens supported by bioreactors:</strong> Provide food and oxygen, creating a self-sustaining cycle within the habitat.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Community and Well-being</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Facilities and programs to support mental health and social well-being:</strong> Ensuring a positive and supportive community environment.</li>
