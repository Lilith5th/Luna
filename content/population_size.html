                        <p>Examining similar isolated communities offers valuable insights for lunar base planning:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station:</strong> Extreme isolation in Antarctica, supporting self-sufficient scientific research in harsh conditions. Population: Approximately 150 in summer, 50 in winter. Diameter: 50m. Average surface area: approx. 2,000 sqm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Submarines:</strong> Extended missions under the sea, entirely self-contained with recycled life support systems. Population: Ranges from 15 to over 150 crew members, depending on the type of submarine. Average length: 70m for nuclear submarines.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aircraft Carriers:</strong> Floating cities with their own infrastructure, hosting thousands for months at sea. Population: Typically up to 5,000 personnel including naval and air crew. Average length: 333m for Nimitz-class carriers.</li>
                            <li><strong>International Space Station (ISS):</strong> Direct analog for space habitats, international crews living and working in space. Population: Usually 6 astronauts, up to 10 during crew changeovers. Total length: approx. 72.8m; habitable volume: approx. 388 cubic meters.</li>
                            <li><strong>Antarctic Research Stations:</strong> Other year-round stations providing data on living in extreme cold and isolation. Population: McMurdo Station can host over 1,000 personnel during peak summer season. Average surface area: approx. 1,500 sqm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biosphere 2:</strong> Closed ecological systems on Earth to test space colonization technologies. Population: Supported 8 researchers when fully operational. Surface area: approx. 12,700 sqm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Offshore Oil Platforms:</strong> Remote, self-sufficient communities working on resource extraction in isolation. Population: Varies widely, from dozens to over 200 people depending on the platform size and function. Average surface area: approx. 5,000 sqm for larger platforms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each example provides valuable lessons in managing small, isolated communities which are directly applicable to lunar base planning.</p>
