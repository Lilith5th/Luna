    <h2>Minimal Population for Lunar Base Food Production</h2>

    <h3>Agricultural Technicians and Horticulturists</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 experts in plant science and aeroponics</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Engineers and Technicians</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 engineers for system maintenance and troubleshooting</li>
        <li>1-3 IT specialists for managing automated systems and data analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Support Staff</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1-3 medical staff for health and emergencies</li>
        <li>1-3 general support personnel for logistics, food preparation, and other daily needs</li>
    </ul>
