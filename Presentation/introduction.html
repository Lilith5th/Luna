    <h1>Concept for a Lunar Food Production Habitat</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        As the space sector is expanding at a rapid pace, it is expected to grow from the current $460 billion industry to a $1-2.5 trillion industry within the next 15 years. With such investments pouring into the sector, it is not far-fetched to imagine thriving lunar colonies in the mid-to-long-term future.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is expectable that colonies and habitats will be purposefully built for certain tasks, including research and development, manufacturing, tourism, food production, and other utilities, material extraction, defense, or a combination of these.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our project focuses on food production, and we will demonstrate the architectural and technological features of such a habitat, along with the challenges needed to achieve those.
    </p>

    <h2>Outline of Necessities and Minimal Technical Aspects</h2>
    <p>
        Considering the cost of spaceflight to remain relatively high, we must envision a base that could be self-sustainable and provide homeostasis for its inhabitants. These necessities include:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Privacy and Minimum Living Space per Person</h3>
    <p>
        Each individual will require a designated amount of private space to ensure comfort and well-being.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Communal Areas</h3>
    <p>
        Relaxation and leisure areas will be essential, and must be calculated in square meters per person.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Workspace</h3>
    <p>
        Adequate workspace per person is necessary to maintain productivity and efficiency.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Sociological and Psychological Aspects</h3>
    <p>
        Determining the minimum population required to sustain a healthy and thriving community is crucial.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Food and Water Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        Ensuring a consistent supply of food and water is vital for the survival of the habitat's inhabitants.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Production Facility</h3>
    <p>
        The facility must be of an estimated minimum size to produce enough food for the base inhabitants, along with a surplus for commercial purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Environmental Concerns</h3>
    <p>
        Addressing and mitigating the environmental impact of the habitat is necessary for sustainability.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Lunar Economy</h3>
    <p>
        Developing a thriving economy on the moon will support the growth and self-sustainability of the habitat.
    </p>

    <h2>Industrial Size Volume with Current Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        Utilizing current technologies to create an industrial-sized volume for food production will be a key challenge and focus of our project.
