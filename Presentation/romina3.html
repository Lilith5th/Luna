    <h1>Some Thoughts on the Waste Collection</h1>
    <p>MOOD envisions a fully operational, highly automated lunar base. Rovers equipped with robot arms collect the waste from the lunar inhabitants on a regular basis and deliver it to the MOOD farm for further storage and processing.</p>
    <p>This implies a certain level of collaboration of the inhabitants: it is crucial to have them collect and seal their solid and liquid waste (including menstrual fluids) correctly in the specific containers and make them available for collection.</p>
