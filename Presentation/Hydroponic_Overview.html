    <h1>Introduction to Hydroponic Water Management for Cultivating Potatoes and Soybeans</h1>
    <p>Hydroponic systems, which support plant growth in a nutrient-rich, water-based solution devoid of soil, offer significant benefits in terms of water efficiency and spatial utilization. This paper explores the specific water requirements and effective management strategies for growing potatoes and soybeans hydroponically. We provide detailed calculations of daily and monthly water usage for these crops, highlighting the capability for water recycling within these systems and initial setup requireme...

    <h2>Key Points from the Discussion:</h2>

    <h3>Potatoes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily Water Usage</strong>: Potatoes require approximately 2 to 5 liters of water per plant per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly Water Requirement</strong>: For a system with 10 plants, about 990 liters is needed over a 30-day period, accounting for replenishments due to evaporation and plant uptake.</li>
        <li><strong>Recyclable Water</strong>: Approximately 891 liters of the total used can be recycled, leaving 99 liters to be added over the month due to losses.</li>
        <li><strong>Initial Tank Volume</strong>: An initial volume of about 150 liters is necessary to start the system for 10 potato plants.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphical Representation</strong>: A graph illustrates the cumulative water volume in the hydroponic tank over 30 days, showing both initial and additional water volumes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Soybeans:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily Water Usage</strong>: Soybeans might use about 1 to 2 liters of water per plant per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly Water Requirement</strong>: Approximately 450 liters is required for 10 plants over a 30-day period.</li>
        <li><strong>Recyclable Water</strong>: Around 405 liters can be recycled, with about 45 liters needing to be replenished over the month.</li>
        <li><strong>Initial Tank Volume</strong>: The system should start with an estimated 100 to 150 liters for 10 soybean plants.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphical Overview</strong>: A graph displays the gradual increase in water volume over 30 days, starting with 100 liters and adding a total of 45 liters incrementally.</li>
    </ul>
