<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Aeroponic systems represent a frontier in agricultural technology, offering a soilless growing method where plants are suspended in an air or mist environment, allowing for efficient nutrient and oxygen absorption directly at the roots. This innovative cultivation method not only optimizes space and conserves water but also potentially enhances plant growth and yield compared to traditional soil-based agriculture. The suitability of various plants for aeroponic systems, including leafy greens, herbs, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers, reflects the versatility and adaptability of this method to different crop types.</p>
<p>In this study, we explore an aeroponic setup characterized by a tower design measuring 2 meters in height with a diameter of 60 cm, which includes a water reservoir capacity of approximately 113 liters. This setup is designed to evaluate the initial and ongoing water requirements of the selected plants, providing a baseline for efficient water use and management in aeroponic systems.</p>
<p>Further, we estimate the monthly output in terms of mass and calculate the total caloric value of the produce. These yield estimations are crucial for determining the practicality and effectiveness of aeroponics in both commercial and personal food production settings. By integrating detailed plant growth data with water usage and nutritional output, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of aeroponic systems, highlighting their potential to transform agricultural practices by increasing efficiency, yield, and sustainability.</p>
