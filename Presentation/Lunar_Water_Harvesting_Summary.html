    <h1>Summary: Estimating the Surface Area Required to Harvest Water on the Lunar Poles</h1>
    
    <h2>Objective:</h2>
    <p>To estimate the surface area on the lunar poles needed to harvest 1,000 liters of water, given varying concentrations of water ice on the Moon's surface.</p>
    
    <h2>Background:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Water on the lunar poles is primarily in the form of ice, located in permanently shadowed regions where sunlight never reaches.</li>
        <li>The concentration of water ice varies significantly, with estimates ranging from 100 grams per square meter (g/m²) to 1,000 g/m².</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Findings:</h2>
    <p>Depending on the concentration, the surface area required to harvest 1,000 liters of water varies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower concentration (100 g/m²):</strong> 10,000 m² of lunar surface needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Median concentration (550 g/m²):</strong> 1,818 m² of lunar surface needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher concentration (1,000 g/m²):</strong> 1,000 m² of lunar surface needed.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>The surface area required to harvest 1,000 liters of water from the lunar poles depends on the specific concentration of water ice in the targeted region. The median estimate suggests that <strong>1,818 m²</strong> of lunar surface might need to be harvested to produce this amount of water.</p>
