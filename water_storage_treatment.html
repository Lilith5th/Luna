            <h3>Distributed Water Storage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>27 interconnected tanks:</strong> Each with 50,000 liters capacity. Distributed throughout the habitat for redundancy to minimize risk of a single point of failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Tanks:</strong> Ensure redundancy so that if one tank fails, others can continue to provide the necessary supply, reducing the risk of a complete water supply disruption.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advanced Filtration and Recycling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multi-stage purification:</strong> Reverse osmosis, UV sterilization, nano-filtration, activated carbon to ensure clean, safe drinking water.</li>
                <li><strong>Grey and black water recycling:</strong> Bioreactors for hydroponic gardens to reduce need for constant resupply from Earth and support food production.</li>
