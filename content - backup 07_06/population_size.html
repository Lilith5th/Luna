            <p>At this stage of the design, establishing baseline population sizes is crucial for ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of the lunar base. A carefully planned population will support the base's operational needs, growth potential, and social structure. Here are the projected phases of population growth:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Phase:</strong> 30-50 people - Focused on setup and initial operations of the base.</li>
                <li><strong>Expansion Phase:</strong> 100-200 people - Aimed at developing a fully functional and sustainable base.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Phase:</strong> 500-1000 people - Designed to ensure a stable, self-sustaining community with comprehensive role fulfillment and built-in redundancy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This strategic population planning allows for the development of a robust community capable of supporting itself through multiple generations. The phased growth approach ensures that each stage of development is manageable and that infrastructure and resources evolve in step with population increases.</p>

            <section id="precedents">
                <p>Here's a look at some isolated communities that serve as precedents for planning a lunar base:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station:</strong> Extreme isolation in Antarctica, supporting self-sufficient scientific research in harsh conditions. <br>Population: Approximately 150 in summer, 50 in winter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Submarines:</strong> Extended missions under the sea, entirely self-contained with recycled life support systems. <br>Population: Ranges from 15 to over 150 crew members, depending on the type of submarine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aircraft Carriers:</strong> Floating cities with their own infrastructure, hosting thousands for months at sea. <br>Population: Typically up to 5,000 personnel including naval and air crew.</li>
                    <li><strong>International Space Station (ISS):</strong> Direct analog for space habitats, international crews living and working in space. <br>Population: Usually 6 astronauts, up to 10 during crew changeovers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Antarctic Research Stations:</strong> Other year-round stations providing data on living in extreme cold and isolation. <br>Population: McMurdo Station can host over 1,000 personnel during peak summer season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biosphere 2:</strong> Closed ecological systems on Earth to test space colonization technologies. <br>Population: Supported 8 researchers when fully operational.</li>
                    <li><strong>Offshore Oil Platforms:</strong> Remote, self-sufficient communities working on resource extraction in isolation. <br>Population: Varies widely, from dozens to over 200 people depending on the platform size and function.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each example provides valuable lessons in managing small, isolated communities which are directly applicable to lunar base planning.</p>
