    <p>To estimate the size of a furnace required for a 1000 ton annual yield of steel:</p>

    <h2>1. Production Capacity and Efficiency:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A typical electric arc furnace (EAF) in commercial settings can produce around 1 ton of steel per hour per metric ton of furnace capacity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Annual Yield Calculation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To produce 1000 tons of steel annually, the furnace would need to operate efficiently throughout the year.</li>
        <li>Assuming 80% operational efficiency (considering downtime for maintenance, etc.), the furnace would need to operate for approximately 2000 hours per year.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Furnace Size Estimation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the furnace operates for 2000 hours per year and produces 1000 tons annually, it would require a nominal capacity of approximately 1.25 tons per hour.</li>
        <li>Given the typical output rate of 1 ton per hour per metric ton of furnace capacity, the furnace would need a nominal capacity of around 1.25 metric tons per hour.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Physical Size (Footprint):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The physical size (footprint) of an EAF suitable for this production level could range from approximately 200 to 500 square meters (mÂ²).</li>
        <li>This includes space for charging equipment, electrodes, refractory lining, and operational space.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Physical Size (Footprint):</h2>
    <ul>	
		<li>To produce one ton (1000 kilograms) of steel from lunar regolith with a 14% iron content and a process efficiency of 90%, approximately 8000 kilograms or 5.5 cubic meters of regolith would be required.</li>
    </ul>	

    <p>These estimates provide a general guideline based on industry norms for small to medium-sized electric arc furnaces used in steel production.</p>
