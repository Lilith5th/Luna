  <p>These concepts explore innovative approaches to integrating vehicle mobility and living quarters for sustained lunar exploration missions.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Integrated Rover-Habitat Concepts:</strong> Designs that combine transportation and living space into a single unit, maximizing mobility and efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Modular Mobile Habitats:</strong> Mobile units with interchangeable modules for various functions such as living quarters, labs, and storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Expandable Rover-Habitats:</strong> Structures that start compact during transport but expand to provide larger living and working spaces on the lunar surface.</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-Functional Vehicles:</strong> Rovers with adaptable interiors that can serve different purposes like sleeping quarters, labs, or workshops.</li>
    <li><strong>Resource Utilization:</strong> Integration of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) to extract and process lunar resources for energy and habitat materials.</li>
    <li><strong>Autonomous and Teleoperated Systems:</strong> Vehicles equipped with advanced navigation and remote operation capabilities for safe lunar surface mobility.</li>
    <li><strong>Radiation Protection and Life Support:</strong> Robust systems for radiation shielding and life support to ensure astronaut safety and habitability.</li>
    <li><strong>International Collaboration:</strong> Cooperation among space agencies and private entities to develop and test these concepts for lunar exploration.</li>
  </ul>
