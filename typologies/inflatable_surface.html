    <h1>Inflatable Surface Lunar Habitats</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Inflatable surface lunar habitats are flexible structures designed to provide living and working space for astronauts on the Moon. These habitats utilize inflatable modules made from lightweight yet durable materials.</p>

    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lightweight and compact for transportation to the Moon</li>
        <li>Expandable design maximizes interior space</li>
        <li>Potential cost savings compared to traditional rigid structures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>One example of inflatable habitat technology is the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), initially designed for the International Space Station (ISS). NASA is also exploring inflatable habitats for its Lunar Gateway project.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Durability against lunar environment conditions (micrometeoroids, radiation, temperature extremes)</li>
        <li>Integration with other lunar infrastructure (power, life support, communication)</li>
        <li>Ensuring long-term structural integrity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
    <p>Inflatable surface lunar habitats could play a crucial role in establishing sustainable human presence on the Moon, offering potential opportunities for scientific research, commercial ventures, and international collaboration.</p>
